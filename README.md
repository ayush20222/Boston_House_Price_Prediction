# Boston_House_Price_Prediction
Project Summary: Boston House Price Prediction

Predicting housing prices is a fundamental challenge in real estate and finance. This project tackles the task of predicting median home prices in the Boston area using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the power of linear regression and random forest regression, we've created models that offer accurate insights into housing market trends.

Key Features:

Machine Learning Models: We employ both linear regression and random forest regression to model housing price predictions, providing a robust basis for analysis.
Data Exploration: In-depth exploration of the dataset using statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to uncover valuable insights and feature relationships.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance with metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared to assess predictive accuracy.
Data Preprocessing: Appropriate data preprocessing techniques to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Scalable and Informative: The project showcases how machine learning can be used to provide actionable insights for real estate professionals and potential homebuyers.
